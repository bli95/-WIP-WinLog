Most of it will be written in C#, compiled with Mono. The keylogger will activate on keyboard detection. 
After being activated the keylogger will also instantly call the screen grabber. 
It will then set off the screen grabber every 10 seconds, sending the key data and screen grabs to a server where the malicious user collects the data.
The server will be used on two different ports, one for the keylogging and one for the screen grabs.
When the server gets the data, it will then send it to two separate folders on the malicious user's system, one for the ksystrokes and one for the screen grabs.
